      |I wandered lonely as a cloud

      |A host, of golden daffodils;
      |Beside the lake, beneath the trees,
      |Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.
      |
      |Continuous as the stars that shine
      |And twinkle on the milky way,
      |They stretched in never-ending line
      |Along the margin of a bay:
      |Ten thousand saw I at a glance,
      |Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.
      |
      |The waves beside them danced; but they
      |Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:
      |A poet could not but be gay,
      |In such a jocund company:
      |I gazed—and gazed—but little thought
      |What wealth the show to me had brought:
      |
      |For oft, when on my couch I lie
      |In vacant or in pensive mood,
      |They flash upon that inward eye
      |Which is the bliss of solitude;
      |And then my heart with pleasure fills,
      |And dances with the daffodils.
